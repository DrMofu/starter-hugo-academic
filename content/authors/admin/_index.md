I'm a master's student in computer science at the University of Southern California. Before that, I received a bachelor's degree in software engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a GPA of 3.9 (4.0 in total).\
\
I had an internship in Sinovation Ventures as a robot 3D vision engineer for 7 months. During that internship, I designed 3 algorithms to allow warehouse robots to recognize goods and detect distance in different application scenarios. And all 3 algorithms are put into use on warehouse robots.\
\
I founded a technical association in my undergraduate school and led 8 team members to design and release 3 applications. I also organized a one-month off-line web development technology sharing class, attracting more than 50 participants.\
\
I am proficient in Python and C++, and is familiar with the Linux environment.
