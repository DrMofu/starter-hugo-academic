  Image retrieval is one of the most critical foundations for many content-based
  search

  applications. However, the image retrieval methods have to balance the demands on

  both training accuracy and generalization effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a

  graph convolution network (GCN) to improve the retrieval robustness by integrating the

  constructs of the normalized residual network (NRN) model and the feature dropout

  (FD) operations. The normalized residual networks use skip connection and normalize

  the vectors in each layer to enhance the learning and strengthen the generalization

  ability. The feature dropout step randomly discards a portion of features in the network

  to prevent the model from overfitting. We tested our proposed model on several

  benchmark datasets and the experiment results showed an improvement of 1 to 3

  mAP in comparison with the state of the art Guided Similarity Separation (GSS)

  algorithm.
